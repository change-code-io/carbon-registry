These Terms shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

**6.3 Disputes** Before filing a claim, each Party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other Party through the notice procedures in these Terms. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of notice, Change Code or the User may bring a formal proceeding.

Notwithstanding anything herein, the arbitration will be held in Travis County, Texas or any other location both Parties agree to in writing.

In the event that you, the User, are using the Services solely for your personal use and not in relation to your employment or any commercial interests, Change Code grants to you the following: (i) Arbitration may be held in the United States county where you live or work; (ii) we will pay all arbitration fees for your individual arbitration for claims less than $50,000; and (iii) we will not seek our attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

**6.6 Governing Law.** These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Western District of Texas.  Each Party hereby submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds with respect to any action or proceeding.
